## 📚 Overview

This submission includes:

- **Part 1: Theoretical Understanding**  
  Core concepts such as algorithmic bias, transparency vs explainability, GDPR’s role in AI governance, and key ethical principles.

- **Part 2: Case Study Analysis**  
  Real-world examples of AI misuse including Amazon’s biased hiring tool and facial recognition in policing. Proposes technical and policy fixes.

- **Part 3: Dataset Audit**  
  A hands-on analysis of the COMPAS recidivism dataset using IBM’s AI Fairness 360. Includes Python code, fairness metrics, and visualizations.

- **Part 4: Ethical Reflection**  
  A personal reflection on building ethical AI systems grounded in justice, autonomy, and non-maleficence.

- **Bonus: Healthcare AI Guidelines**  
  A policy framework outlining ethical deployment of AI in medical settings, with transparency, bias mitigation, and consent protocols.
